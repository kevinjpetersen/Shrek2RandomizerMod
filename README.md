# Shrek 2 Randomizer Mod
This is a mod for Shrek 2 which can randomize content for each playthough.

# How does it work?
1. You start out by [downloading the application](https://github.com/kevinjpetersen/Shrek2RandomizerMod/releases/download/Stable/Shrek2RandomizerMod.exe) (.exe)
2. Place this .exe in the System folder of your Shrek 2 Installation.
3. Open the game
4. Run the .exe (Shrek2RandomizerMod.exe)
5. Everything is now randomized and can be reverted by relaunching the game.
6. If you want to re-randomize mid-game you can run the application again.

# What is currently randomized / supported?
- Playable Characters (Shrek, Donkey, PIB, etc.)
- NPCs (Bandits, Knights, Frogs, etc.)

# What is coming soon?
- Static Mesh Randomizer
- Damage Randomizer
- Scale Randomizer
- Animation Speed Randomizer
- Other stuff (If you have ideas, please let me know :) )
