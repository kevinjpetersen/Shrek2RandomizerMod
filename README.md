# Shrek 2 Randomizer Mod
This is a mod for Shrek 2 which can randomize content for each playthough.

# How does it work?
1. You start out by [downloading the application](https://github.com/kevinjpetersen/Shrek2RandomizerMod/releases/download/Stable/Shrek2RandomizerMod.exe) (.exe)
2. Place this .exe in the System folder of your Shrek 2 Installation.
3. Run the .exe, now a ``SH2Random`` file is generated in the same folder, this contains all the random data
4. Inside the game (whether it's on the main menu or in-game), open the console and type ``exec SH2Random``
5. Everything is now randomized and can be reverted by relaunching the game.
6. If you want to re-randomize mid-game you can run the application again and run the console command once again.
